abstract: "For over a decade, Scotland has implemented and operationalised a system of Safe Havens providing secure analytics platforms for researchers to access linked, de-identified Electronic Health Records (EHRs) while managing the risk of unauthorised re-identification. In this paper a perspective is provided on the state-of-the-art Scottish Safe Haven Network, including its evolution, to define the key activities required to scale Scottish Safe Haven Network capability to facilitate research and healthcare improvement initiatives.
